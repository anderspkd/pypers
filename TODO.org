#+TITLE: TODOs that need to-doing

* Basic [0/7]

  - [ ] (somekind of) abstraction layer for the database. See ~pypers/papers.py~
    - [ ] Setters and getters for metadata of paper
    - [ ] Paper authors from Author objects
    - [ ] Paper authors from Strings
  - [ ] basic query functionality. Search in papers, authors etc.
  - [ ] Consider whether or not it makes sense to save a reference to
    the ~PaperMetaData~ entry in the ~Paper~ class (like we do with
    ~_db_obj~).
  - [ ] Some paper items should be immutable (e.g., title, year)
  - [ ] Author should be (firstname, lastname) instead of just (name),
    I think.
  - [ ] Custom exceptions for the classes in ~papers.py~.
  - [ ] Keep track of publishers

* Usability [0/2]

  - [ ] (somekind of) user interface. E.g., a script that lets you do
    easy quering from the commandline.
  - [ ] Script that can automatically extract information about PDF
    files, and use this information to create entries in the database.

* Other [1/4]

  - [X] A file in the ~tests~ directory containing some example data,
    that can easily be integrated into tests
  - [ ] More test paper data
  - [ ] More complex test paper data (e.g., citations)
  - [ ] Pretty printers/formatters. That is, functionality that takes
    a paper and produces a string formatted according to e.g., APA
    style guide.
